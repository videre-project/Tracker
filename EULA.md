Effective Date: December 12, 2025

This End-User License Agreement and Terms of Use (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (“User” or “you”) and Videre Project (“we”, “us”, or “Videre”) regarding your use of the Videre Tracker desktop application (“Software”) and any associated online services, APIs, or features provided by Videre (collectively, the “Services”).

By installing, downloading, accessing, or using the Software or Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not install or use the Software or Services.

**1. License to the Software**  
The Software is licensed to you under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the “Apache License”). A full copy of the Apache License is included in the `LICENSE` file distributed with the Software and is available at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.  

Your rights to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute the Software are governed exclusively by the Apache License. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Apache License with respect to the Software itself, the Apache License will control.  

This Agreement does not restrict any rights granted to you under the Apache License.

**2. Access to and Use of Services**  
The Software may interact with Videre’s online Services, including but not limited to:  
- The NBAC inference service for deck archetype classification.  
- The Videre API for uploading, pulling, or syncing gameplay and related data.  

Access to and use of these Services is provided “as available” and is subject to the terms of this Agreement. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any Service features at any time without notice.

**3. Acceptable Use**  
You agree not to use the Software or Services:  
- For any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable law.  
- To transmit malware, viruses, or harmful code.  
- To abuse, overload, interfere with, or disrupt the Services, servers, networks, or other users (including excessive API requests, scraping, or unauthorized data mining).  
- To attempt unauthorized access to any Videre systems, accounts, or data.  
- In any way that infringes the rights of others or violates third-party terms (e.g., Magic: The Gathering Online terms of service).  

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to Services for violations of this section, without affecting your rights under the Apache License to the Software you have downloaded.

**4. User Content and Data**  
If you upload, submit, or transmit any data through the Services (e.g., gameplay logs, decklists), you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, store, process, analyze, and (where applicable) publicly display or publish that data solely to provide, maintain, and improve the Services.  

For decklists derived from official Magic: The Gathering Online (MTGO) events, we may publish such decklists on our website (videreproject.com) or other Videre-controlled platforms as part of event coverage or public statistics features. Publishing decklists for any other purposes or from non-official sources is optional and requires your explicit action (e.g., manual upload or opt-in consent).  

You represent that any data you provide does not infringe third-party rights and complies with applicable laws (including MTGO terms). We may anonymize or aggregate data for analytics and model training.

Copies of applicable licenses, copyright notices, and attribution information (if any) are provided in the `LICENSE` file, `NOTICE` file (if present), or within the Software distribution.

**6. No Warranty / Disclaimer**  
THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR ERRORS, BUGS, OR INTERRUPTIONS IN THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES. YOUR USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

**7. Limitation of Liability**  
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, VIDERE PROJECT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED $100 (USD).

**8. Termination**  
We may terminate your access to the Services at any time for violation of this Agreement. Termination does not revoke or affect your rights under the Apache License to any copy of the Software lawfully obtained and retained by you.
